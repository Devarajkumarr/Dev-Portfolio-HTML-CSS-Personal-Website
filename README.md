# Dev-Portfolio-HTML-CSS-Personal-Website
This is a responsive frontend developer portfolio built using only HTML and CSS. It showcases my skills, projects, and contact information in a clean, professional layout without using JavaScript or any frontend frameworks. The design follows modern UI/UX principles using Flexbox, Grid, media queries, and CSS animations to enhance interactivity.
