                            👋 I'm a Software Developer and Data Analyst passionate about building clean, user-friendly web experiences and uncovering valuable insights from data. My work thrives at the intersection of frontend development, backend logic, and data analytics, where design, usability, and performance come together.

                            💡 With a strong foundation in both web development and analytics, I craft responsive interfaces and dive deep into data to solve real-world problems and inform decision-making.

                            🔧 Tech Stack & Tools:
                            Frontend: HTML, CSS, Java (Intermediate), Python (for web & automation)

                            Backend & Databases: SQL, Python backend, basic Java backend, API integration

                            Data Analytics: Python (Pandas, NumPy), Excel, Power BI, Tableau

                            Other Skills: Dashboard creation, data pipelines, automation, problem-solving

                            🚀 What I Enjoy:
                            Designing intuitive, accessible, and responsive web pages.

                            Automating workflows and data processing.

                            Creating compelling dashboards and visual reports.

                            Combining logic with design for user-centered experiences.

                            📊 I've worked on projects involving e-commerce sales analysis, inventory management, and interactive dashboards that turn raw data into meaningful insights.

                            📚 Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in JavaScript, Node.js, and Big Data technologies to enhance my full-stack and data engineering capabilities.

                            🐱 Outside of tech, I enjoy vibing to melodies, hit songs, and spending time with my family while staying curious and creative.
